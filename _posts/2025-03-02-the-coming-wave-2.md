I recently finished **The Coming Wave** by Mustafa Suleyman and Michael Bhaskar, and I’d like to share some of my thoughts, particularly on the topic of AI. The book explores the four transformative forces of the coming wave: **Artificial Intelligence, Synthetic Biology, Quantum Computing**, and emerging energy sources like **Nuclear Fusion**. AI and quantum computing are dominating the conversation these days, with new LLM models being launched almost weekly and major tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google unveiling groundbreaking research in quantum computing.

So far, we’ve experienced 24 major waves of innovation. Over a span of 10,000 years up until 1000 BCE, 7 general-purpose technologies emerged. Between 1700 and 1900, there were 6 waves, ranging from the steam engine to electricity. In the past 100 years alone, we’ve seen 7 new waves, from airplanes to nuclear power.
